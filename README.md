# figma-config-archive

The goal of this project is to develop a simple react app for figma's config conference archived content. As the event conference continues to grow, it would be nice to have a centralized place to browse past content.

## Key technology

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) (JSX, Context, and Hooks)
- [Emotion(CSS)](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction)
- [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/)
- [Git / Github](https://github.com/)

## Step 1: Research

As I look over the figma sites, I want to get a sense for the design, look, and feel of figma sites. I have the idea that figma config could use a archive page.

## Step 2: Design the archive page

I used figma to design a simple page and ensure the vision in my mind makes sense on paper.

## Step 3: Develop

- Create react app: `npx create-react-app figma-config-archive`
- Run the app using: `yarn start`
- View the app at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
